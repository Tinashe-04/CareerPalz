A company has to submit a petition on behalf of the requested specialty worker, and this petition needs to get approved by USCIS in order for an H-1B visa to be issued to a specialty worker for them to begin work at said U.S. company. How does my company submit a petition? The company needs 3 items to file a petition: a certified Labor Condition Application, a selected registration, and a filing fee. What we want to focus on today is the selected registration. Assuming everything else is provided or done correctly, this is the only portion of the petitioning process that is determined randomly.\n",
